## Email Spam Detection System using Machine Learning

This project, developed during my data science internship at Oasis Infobyte, focuses on building an effective email spam detection system using Python and machine learning techniques.

### Project Overview:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess a large email dataset, handle missing values, and transform text data for machine learning.
  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract key features like sender address, recipient list, subject line, and email body to create meaningful inputs for the model.

- **Model Selection:** Experiment with machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, to find the best model for detecting spam.

- **Evaluation:** Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate the model's performance.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model hyperparameters to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.

- **Cross-Validation:** Apply cross-validation and test on new datasets to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

- **Deployment & Ethical Considerations:** Explore deployment strategies for real-world use while maintaining privacy and data security.

 **Future Work:**
We address potential challenges like spammers' evolving techniques and outline future research opportunities to enhance spam detection accuracy.
